## Overview
This plugin wraps (https://cht.sh)[] in a telescope picker, allowing you to recursively search through cht.sh entries and them open them in local buffers. 
The plugin caches responses from cht.sh to your local filesystem to make frequent sheets load faster and available offline.

## Dependencies
'nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim' plugin.
